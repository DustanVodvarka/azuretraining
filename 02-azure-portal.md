# Azure Portal

The Azure Portal is a web based UI for Azure. Everything you can do in Azure CLI, you can do in the portal. Generally, the CLI is a more efficient way to generate resources, but the portal is great for exploration and monitoring of resources.

1. Head over to portal.azure.com

2. On the left hand menu, click "Resource Groups". This will bring up the Resource Group list. In Azure, this is referred to a as a "blade". Resource groups logically group Azure resources. Generally, you make a resource group per application.

3. Click "Add". This will bring up the "Create a Resource Group" blade.

4. Fill out the blade.
    * Select the appropriate subscription. If you have an MSDN sub, pick the Visual Studio subscription. 
    * For the name, enter in whatever you want. We'll use it in the next exercise.
    * Select the North Central US resource group.

5. Click "Create". You should see your resource group in the list after a few seconds.
